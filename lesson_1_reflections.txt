how did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
viewing the difference between two files helped because it made me understand at what line i made a mistake.
it would have took a lot more time if i searched for it manually.
this command is quite more usefull and perhaps the only way the find a bug in a program, which is too long.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
we can just go through the process in which the final program was created.
this helps in developing new techniques and learning through the mistakes.
it helps not to commit such mistakes later in the future, which makes our code efficient.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
