What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when we initialize a repository, it creates a new file which is generally hidden.
that file stores all the history of the changes make to the directory.
it is needed so that we can have an account of all the changes we make, while developing something.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
staging area is the intermediate stage between the working directory and the repository.
when we type the command "git add", the files we add goes to the staging area from the working directory.
and later when we commit, the things from the staging area moves to the repository.
